    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken and Waffles Recipe – Better than Roscoe’s Chicken and Waffles recipe. Imagine perfectly seasoned and crispy fried chicken on top of a fluffy, sweet and tender waffle! </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 Chiken Wings</li>
        <li>2 cups Buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 ts Hot Sauce</li>
        <li>2 ts Worcestershire</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups All-purpose Flour</li>
        <li>4 tb Cornstarch</li>
        <li>3 tb Seasoned Salt</li>
        <li>2 ts Paprika</li>
        <li>2 ts Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1 ts Garlic Salt</li>
        <li>1 tb Onion Powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add chicken wings to a ziploc bag.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together buttermilk, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce and pour mixture over chicken in ziploc.</li>
        <li>Seal bag and marinate in refrigerator for at least 2 hours or up to 8 hours (overnight).</li>
        <li>While chicken marinades, prepare buttermilk waffles batter according to instructions HERE.</li>
        <li>When you are finished marinading chicken, add flour, cornstarch, seasoned salt, paprika, black pepper, garlic salt and onion powder to a paper bag and shake to blend well.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and dip into seasoned flour thoroughly coating each wing.</li>
        <li>Add wings to a baking sheet. Once finished coating chicken, place in refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Add 3/4-1 inch of oil to a cast iron skillet or heavy bottom skillet and heat over medium high heat.</li>
        <li>While oil is warming, also turn on oven to 275 degrees.</li>
        <li>(This is my test for knowing when the oil is ready: My mom always tossed a tiny bit of flour in the oil and if it began to fry and sizzle the oil was ready).
        </li>
        <li>Fry four wings at a time making sure to not overcrowd the pan. After each side is golden brown, put the pan's top on the chicken to steam and make sure the inside of the chicken is done. Remove the top and continue to fry outside until it is crispy.
        </li>
        <li>Remove wings and place on paper towels to drain. Place wings on a baking sheet covered with parchment and add to oven while finishing the other wings.
        </li>
        <li>Fry the remaining chicken and drain and add to oven. Add the remaining wings to the oven.</li>
        <li>Add butter to waffles and allow to melt.</li>
        <li>    Lastly, layer each finished waffle with two chicken wings, drizzle with warm pure maple syrup and sprinkle with confectioner's sugar and parsley to serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
